# sql_challenge This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
Step 1: Data Modeling. I had to inspect the CSV Files 
Open each CSV file and examine the columns and the data they contain.
Identify the primary keys (PK) in each table. 
Identify the foreign keys (FK). 
Determine the relationships between the tables, such as one-to-many or many-to-many, a visual representation of the tables and their relationships, making it easier to understand and communicate the database structure.
Then create the table schema for each of the six CSV files, firstly define the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for each table. The tables should be created in the correct order to handle the foreign keys, also the process of importing each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

Step 3: Data Analysis  providing queries to answer the following questions

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
